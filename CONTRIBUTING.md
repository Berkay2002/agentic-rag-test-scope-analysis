# Contributing Guidelines

## About This Project

This repository contains the implementation for a Master's Thesis research project conducted in collaboration with Ericsson. The code is made publicly available to support:

- **Academic Transparency**: Open science and reproducible research
- **Peer Review**: Enabling thesis committee and research community review
- **Educational Value**: Serving as a reference implementation for similar research

## Academic Use

This is primarily a **research artifact**, not an open-source project seeking contributions in the traditional sense. However, we welcome:

### ✅ Encouraged Interactions

- **Issues for Bugs**: If you find bugs or errors in the implementation, please open an issue
- **Questions**: Academic questions about the methodology, implementation, or results
- **Suggestions**: Constructive feedback on the research approach or implementation
- **Citations**: If this work helps your research, please cite it appropriately

### ⚠️ Limited Scope for Contributions

- **No Feature Requests**: This implements specific thesis research questions
- **No Major Refactoring**: The code reflects the thesis methodology as approved
- **Academic Timeline**: Updates may be limited by thesis defense schedule

## How to Engage

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or error:

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Provide context**: What were you trying to do?
3. **Include details**: Error messages, logs, environment info
4. **Minimal reproduction**: Steps to reproduce the issue

### Asking Questions

For academic or technical questions:

1. Open a **Discussion** (preferred) or Issue
2. Clearly state your question or area of interest
3. Reference specific sections of code or documentation
4. Be patient - responses depend on thesis schedule

### Suggesting Improvements

If you have suggestions:

1. Understand this is research-in-progress with defined scope
2. Frame suggestions in academic context (methodology, evaluation, etc.)
3. Open a Discussion for non-critical suggestions
4. Open an Issue for critical bugs or errors

## Research Ethics

This project involves:

- **Synthetic Data**: All telecommunications data is synthetically generated
- **No Proprietary Information**: No Ericsson proprietary code or data
- **Academic Standards**: Adheres to university research ethics
