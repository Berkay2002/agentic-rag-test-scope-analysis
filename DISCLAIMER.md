# Academic Research - Usage Disclaimer

## Purpose

This repository contains research software developed as part of a Master's Thesis conducted in collaboration with Ericsson. It implements and evaluates an agentic GraphRAG system for test scope analysis.

## Intended Use

### ✅ Appropriate Use

- **Academic Research**: Studying RAG architectures, knowledge graphs, or agentic systems
- **Education**: Learning about LangGraph, Neo4j, or retrieval strategies
- **Reproducibility**: Verifying thesis results and methodology
- **Citation**: Referencing in academic papers with proper attribution
- **Experimentation**: Personal learning and non-commercial experiments

### ❌ Inappropriate Use

- **Production Deployment**: This is research code, not production-ready
- **Commercial Use**: Prohibited without explicit permission (see LICENSE)
- **Critical Systems**: Not suitable for safety-critical or mission-critical applications
- **Proprietary Development**: Do not incorporate into closed-source commercial products

## Important Limitations

### Research Context

1. **Synthetic Data**: All telecommunications test data is synthetically generated for research purposes
2. **Academic Scope**: Implements specific research questions; not a general-purpose tool
3. **Evaluation Focus**: Optimized for research evaluation, not operational efficiency
4. **Limited Validation**: Validated in research context, not extensive real-world testing

### Technical Limitations

1. **No SLA**: No service-level agreements or uptime guarantees
2. **Limited Support**: Maintenance depends on thesis timeline
3. **API Costs**: Using Google Generative AI and database services incurs costs
4. **Scalability**: Designed for research datasets, not production scale
5. **Security**: No security audit performed; use at your own risk

### Software State

- **Development Status**: Beta / Research Prototype
- **Test Coverage**: Partial (research focus)
- **Documentation**: Academic/research oriented
- **Maintenance**: Limited post-thesis defense

## Data Privacy

- **No Real Data**: This system uses only synthetic telecommunications data
- **No PII**: No personally identifiable information collected or processed
- **Local Processing**: When you run it, data stays in your configured databases
- **API Calls**: LLM calls to Google AI; review their privacy policy

## Dependencies

This project depends on third-party services and libraries:

- **Google Generative AI**: Subject to Google's terms of service
- **Neo4j**: Graph database (Aura or self-hosted)
- **PostgreSQL/Neon**: Vector database
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: Apache 2.0 License
- **Other dependencies**: See pyproject.toml

**Your Responsibility**: Review terms of service for all dependencies.
